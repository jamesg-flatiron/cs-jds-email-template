<p>Before enrolling in the Flatiron School, you probably downloaded one of our Jobs Reports to help decide if Flatiron School was right for you. Now, we're working with our auditors to compile and verify outcomes data for your cohort, to be released in our annual report. Please fill out and submit the above survey to help us ensure we have correct data represented in the audit. As always, this data will be kept confidential between Flatiron School and the auditors - your name will not appear anywhere in the report, nor will any other identifying information.
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about our outcomes reporting, I'm happy to answer anything at all about our audit content or process.
</p>
<p>
Hope you're feeling excited and proud about your job. Congratulations again on your new career!
</p>
Best,
<br/>
[Coach]
